"""
Relay websocket messages between the FCND Unity Simulator
and a python client.

This must be done due to the current limitation of C# System.Net
not being usable in a WebGL build.

Instructions:
    - Run this file prior to running the simulator scene.
    - In the simulator scene make sure the transport protocol is set to WebSocket.
    - Run the simulator scene.
    - Run a file using a WebSocketConnection, such as test_websocket_connection.py
      in this directory.
